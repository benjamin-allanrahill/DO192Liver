# D0192Liver_aaRS

This is the repository for the DO192 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase project. This git repo does not include any .Rdata files that are used as input or are generated as output. It also does not include and .png files or any output files. 
This is for the purpose of not pushing the large files to the git repo. This repo is mainly for the version control of the scripts used to generate the output. The input and output files can be found on a hard drive that Steve 
probably has his hands on.
